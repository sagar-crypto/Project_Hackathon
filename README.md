# Project_Hackathon

Pitch:
Sustainability reporting is the need of the hour for organizations to comply with EU regulations towards environment. One of its important aspects is EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation). Currently, there is no standardized platform from where companies can gain data on sustainability report of their suppliers, and many times it happens that they have to ask for same information repeatedly from their suppliers. Therefore, our inspiration is to develop such a one-stop solution and standardized platform.

What It Does: 
Our concept basically does the following:

1. Suppliers can enter all of their data at once in the platform, including uploading certificates that can prefill the form which asks for details that EUDR asks for.
2. Companies will have the option to generate a consolidated report for their suppliers, and can use them accordingly to meet the sustainability demands.
3. There will be an LLM-based FAQs chatbot that answers all of the queries related to EUDR, and hence prevents unnecessary Google searches or confusions on topics that the supplier might not be aware of.

How we built it
Research and design- Brainstorming on EUDR and the important fields that are asked under it. The design is very simple and intuitive and goes by the theme of Connecting the Unconnected.
